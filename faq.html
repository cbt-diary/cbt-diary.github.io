    <p class="title">What is this?</p>
    <p>This is a self-therapy tool.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="title">How do I use it?</p>
    <p>Try to remember situation which made you feel bad. Now, fill the form. First, summarize the situation in "title" field.

        <br><br><strong>The first part - describe the situation</strong><br>
        Then, estimate how bad do you feel ("discomfort level"), and select emotions you feel ("anxious", "angry" etc.). 
        Describe situation in details with "situation" field and write all your negative thoughts in "negative thoughts".
        <br><br><strong>The second part - change the way you are thinking</strong><br>
        Find distortions in your thoughts (you can reread what you wrote in "negative thoughts" field to make it simpler).
        More information about distortions <a href="distortions.html">HERE</a>. Then, try to "challenge" how you think by giving positive examples
        of things that happened, contrarguments to your negative thoughts etc. 
        Try to think in different way, argue with your negative thoughts! More about "challenge" field <a href="">HERE (not available, work in progress)</a>.
        <br><br><strong>The third part - short reflection</strong><br>
        Select how do you feel ("discomfort level") after doing the exercise. Did you feel better?
        If not, don't worry! Just do this exercise on regular basic and you will feel the difference.
        In "conclusion" field, you can write your reflection about the situation. You can write anything here!
        I usually write a short summary of "challenge" field.

    <p class="title">What is CBT?</p>
    <p>
        This is an exercise based on CBT. CBT stands for cognitive-behavioral therapy. It is a form of therapy. 
        The purpose of this exercise is to try to think
        about different situations differently. Lot of times, we think very negatively about something, but our thinking
        is distorted. Maybe the situation was not that bad? This exercise will help you see the world differently. And probably
        going to make you feel better.

    <p class="title">What other techniques can I use to feel better?</p>
    <p>
        Mindfulness/meditation is another popular therapy technique. I am using Headspace, but there are lot of free alternatives,
        like Insight Timer or Breathe (android).
